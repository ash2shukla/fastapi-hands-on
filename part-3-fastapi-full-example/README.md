1. The intent of this app structure is to make sure that your app can scale ( from code pov )
2. In parallel to this README.md file should go requirements.txt, Dockerfile, .dockerignore, .rull.toml, compose, Makefile etc.
3. You can just create a main.py and that's also fine if scope of your work is small
4. If unsure then follow this structure
